userscripts
===========

this gets a whole repository in case I ever write more than one

I guess github wants me to have a readme in all caps as well

scripts
-
######Ihavenofriends
-   greasemonkey script based on http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/150411 but without any branding or shifty behavior.
-   enables removal of friends and liked pages en masse.
-   tested on greasemonkey on firefox 18.0.1 on i686 linux but I doubt it would work differently on other platforms.
