userscripts
===========

this gets a whole repository in case I ever write more than one

I guess github wants me to have a readme in all caps as well

scripts
-
######Ihavenofriends
-   greasemonkey script based on http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/150411 but without any branding or shifty behavior.
-   enables mass friend removal, and maybe eventually some other stuff:
    -   quitting groups
    -   kicking people out of groups
    -   unliking pages
