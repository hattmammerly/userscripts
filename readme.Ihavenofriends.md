I'll figure out this fancy markdown stuff I guess

it's just a hack. I'm not responsible if anything goes wrong. 

so I gave up on all the groups stuff. I can't submit the form that pops up in the dialog box because the page keeps refreshing, and I don't know how to bypass it. that's okay. it removes friends and liked pages totally fine.

to remove friends, go to your profile, then 'friends' and it's pretty straightforward from there. there will be checkboxes next to friends, and a labelled button to press.

to remove pages, go to your profile, and at the bottom of the "likes" page it will show pages you've liked by year. select the checkboxes of pages you want to remove and then hit the button on top. it might not refresh, but it still works.

code adapted from: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/150411
that script works fine but it's branded shamelessly and there are ~45 lines of nothingness-code in the middle to diguise where it makes you like his website on facebook. so I'm doing my own thing.
