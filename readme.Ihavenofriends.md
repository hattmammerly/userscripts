I'll figure out this fancy markdown stuff I guess

be gentle
-
it's just a hack. I'm not responsible if anything goes wrong. 

todo:
-
-   reorganize the code and see if I can make it less choppy
-   find a good way to differentiate between search view and all view
-   find a good way to determine if I'm dealing with friends, groups, group members, or liked pages
-   implement the previous two

backstory:
-
code adapted from: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/150411
that script works fine but it's banrded shamelessly and there are ~45 lines of nothingness-code in the middle to diguise where it makes you like his website on facebook. so I'm doing my own thing.
