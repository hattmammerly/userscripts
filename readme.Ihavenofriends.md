I'll figure out this fancy markdown stuff I guess

be gentle
-
it's just a hack. I'm not responsible if anything goes wrong. 

todo:
-
-   reorganize the code and see if I can make it less choppy
-   put checkboxes on the "likes" page and the "groups" page
    -   this... isn't going well. work in progress hah
-   troubleshoot executing the removal scripts since those are guesses

note: giving up on mass expulsion of group members. I had the button in place but then I broke it somehow and now it won't come back. I don't need it, anyway.
anyway, the script responsible for that is /ajax/groups/members/remove.php and seems to want the data _group_id_ and _uid_
maybe I'll make that into its own script sometime later.

backstory:
-
code adapted from: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/150411
that script works fine but it's banrded shamelessly and there are ~45 lines of nothingness-code in the middle to diguise where it makes you like his website on facebook. so I'm doing my own thing.
